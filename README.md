# HR Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes employee turnover ("Attrition") using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**.  
The goal is to explore and understand the key drivers of employee attrition and to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

The project includes **data cleaning**, **data preparation**, **statistical analysis**, and the development of a **machine learning classification model**.

## Project Status
The project is **currently in progress**.  
Data cleaning, feature engineering, and initial exploratory analysis have been completed.  
Additional statistical tests, model development, and documentation are being added step by step.

## Project Objectives
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in employee data.
- **Analyze Key Attrition Drivers**  
  Examples: OverTime, YearsAtCompany, BusinessTravel, JobSatisfaction, MonthlyIncome.
- **Clean and Prepare Data**  
  Handle missing values, format variables, encode categories, and create new features.
- **Conduct Statistical Tests**  
  Chi-square tests, t-tests, Spearman correlations, hypothesis testing on attrition factors.
- **Build Predictive Machine Learning Models**  
  Train and evaluate classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Visualize Insights**  
  Create heatmaps, bar plots, attrition rate charts, and other visualizations.
